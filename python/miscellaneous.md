## What is Unicode?
A character set. UTF denotes a family of encoding schemes. Text in Unicode is represented as a sequence of code points. The encoding scheme is what turns a sequence of code points into a sequence of bytes. UTF-8 is a variable length encoding scheme, where a code point requires at least 8 bits (1 byte).
